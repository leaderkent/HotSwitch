# In a blink of an eye

You may use `Command+Tab` for default window switcher of macOS, otherwise, use Mission Control or Dock and move pointer and click a window.
However, these ways are not smart.

That is because you have to look, recognize and find where the target window you want to activate is.
It takes time to find the window.
Needless to say, moving pointer and clicking window are not fast.

**HotSwitch has adopted a quite different method.**

That is a way like 2 stroke hotkey.
The key bind is fixed at all times.
Therefore, you don't need time to think and it is quick.
**You can switch any windows in a blink of an eye.**

When you would think "Let's switch to the window...", **and at that moment, the switching would been already finished**.
