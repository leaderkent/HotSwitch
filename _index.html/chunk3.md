# In a blink of an eye

You might have used `Command+Tab` for default window switcher of Mac OS X, otherwise, have used Mission Control or Dock and move pointer and click a window.
However, these ways are not smart.

That is because you have to look and recognize and find where the target window which you want to activate is showing.
The time to find the window is very slow.
Needless to say, moving pointer and clicking window is not fast.

**HotSwitch have adopted a quite different method.**

That is a way like 2 stroke hotkey.
The key bind is fixed at all times.
Therefore, the time to thinking is not occured, so it is rapid.
**You can switch any windows in a blink of an eye.**

When you would think "Let's switch to the window...", **and at that moment, the switching would been already finished**.
