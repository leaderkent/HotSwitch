# Preferences

HotSwitch needs simple registration which combines with target windows.

1. Press `Tab` or cursor key to select window on showing panel.
2. Press `Space` to start **registration mode**.
3. Type a key to be combined with the window.

The registered key of step 3 is used for activating target window.

In the example below, a window of iTunes combines with `t` key.
That is to say, even if you are face on any window at that time, you press `Command+.` and type `t`, and then the window of iTunes is activated immediately.

The important thing is that **the 2 stroke key bind is fixed anytime**.
It looks like that 2 stroke hotkey is working to activate any windows.

When you want to remove the registered key, select the window and press `Delete`.

If you want to change the basic hotkey to show HotSwitch panel (default: `Command+.`), press `Command+,` to show preferences window when the panel is shown.
